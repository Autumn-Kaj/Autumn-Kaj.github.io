                        <p>Out of the 130,930 public schools in the United States, one thing remains the same: Students are constantly under social pressure to fit in. From peer pressure to standardized testing, the school system often promotes similarities instead of celebrating differences. (Data from www.edweek.org)</p>

                        <h4 class="medium-title">"Another Brick in the Wall"</h4>
                        <p>A consequence of this "promotion of similarities" by the school system is that students begin to lose their sense of identity. When celebrating differences, we thrive on creativity and uniqueness.</p>

                        <p>Creativity and fashion go hand in hand. Many kids use clothing to set themselves apart from the crowd, or to say something about themselves.<br>One article of clothing that is particularly important is SHOES. Sporty kids wear Jordans, art kids wear Converse, alternative and skater kids wear Vans. These footwear choices say who you are and what you are about when you are in school.</p>

                        <p>The steps are simple: Just remove the upper by unzipping the fabric top from the midsole. Then the user can draw on the fabric on a flat surface, or toss it in the washing machine.</p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>Kids already draw on shoes, and it has been popular among alternative culture for a long time.<br>So what makes Canvas any different than a pair of white Vans?<br> Canvas's upper is specifically designed to be removed, and laid out on a flat surface for optimal drawing.<br>And, while you could put a pair of Vans in the washing machine a few times, it would degrade the connections in the sole and mid-sole, causing the shoe to wear and eventually come apart.<br> That's why Canvas is so easy to wash, since you can just wash the fabric, and protect the soles from needless wear.</p>
